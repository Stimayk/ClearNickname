# ClearNickname
**Adds automatic nickname clearing if certain keys are found.**

It is essentially a primitive remake of a [plugin from CS:GO](https://github.com/theelsaud/Clear-Nickname)

By default there is a database of sites to block from the original plugin


New banned words can be added at 
```/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/ClearNickname/ClearNicknameConfig.ini```

By adding a new line
```New line = new word to be blocked```




There are translations and logging.
